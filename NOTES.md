DESCRIPTION:
A square of squares
You like building blocks. You especially like building blocks that are squares. And what you even like more, is to arrange them into a square of square building blocks!

However, sometimes, you can't arrange them into a square. Instead, you end up with an ordinary rectangle! Those blasted things! If you just had a way to know, whether you're currently working in vain… Wait! That's it! You just have to check if your number of building blocks is a perfect square.

TASK:
Given an integral number, determine if it's a square number:

In mathematics, a square number or perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer; in other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.

The tests will always use some integral number, so don't worry about that in dynamic typed languages.

DOMAIN:
Return must be an integral number
Perfect Square is an integer that is the square of an intenger 
Or it is the product of some intenger with itself
-> Perfect Square = √n or n2 or n × n
Tets will always use integral number
If the result is -1 the return will be -> false
If the result is 0 the return will be -> true
If the result is 3 the return will be -> false
If the result is 4 the return will be -> true
If the result is 25 the return will be -> true
If the result is 26 the return will be -> false
